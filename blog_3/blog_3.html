    <h3>
        Collaging!
     </h3>
                <p>
                    Collaging is forever fun. At home, and in the city too, there's is a really wonderful store called Scrap. It offers a variety of upcycled art supplies at super inexpesnive prices. I personally don't just have magazines lying around to collage with and I often don't want to have to print for the purpose of collaging. So, Scrap is a sweet resource in light of that that has so so many magazines. The magazines I've been particuarly drawn to there are their vintage national geographic magazines as well as their vintage LIFE magazines. 

                    I say all of this because collaging can be not just a singular activity but you can make a fun trip out of it. 

                    For this piece I chose to use primarly pieces that i cut out from a LIFE magazine. I had just been looking through Pinterest and got some inspiration from all of the patchwork clothing that people are creating. I decided to make my girl in my collage be able to join in on the fun too and have her own pathwork looking skirt and top. I used mod podge and messily cut out and pieced together lots of various colors of the magazine. Then, I cut out some other cute characters and placed them around her in a silly fashion.

                    This collage feels like a work in progress so something I want to come back to in the future. The idea that I can come back to it though and it not being a big deal keeps it fun!!!
