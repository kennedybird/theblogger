            <h2>Birthday Crown For Friend</h2>
       
       
            <p> When I am in the process of making something for someone I keep that principle in mind, knowing that I am putting love into this and they will see that regardless of if it turns out exactly how I want it to.

            For this creative session, I created a card! I chose to use thick cardstock as a base. I also used cardstock on a separate sheet to create my little characters and additional elements that I added to the page. This 3d effect adds dimensionality that I love. I also think being able to glue pieces after having painted them lets me get my hands dirty which I find enjoyable</p>
